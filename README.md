A simple website where you search recipes on ingredients that you have on your fridge.

Use `npm install` to install all the dependencies of the project.

The developer are using a third party API called [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) for getting all the recipes and ingredients. The project is not yet complete because the developer is thinking if he will subscribe for the additional features that he clearly need.

Future features:

1. A recipe result for multiple ingredients
2. Limit the result to ingredients added on the list
