It is a simple website where you search for recipes on ingredients in your fridge. Use `npm install` to install all the dependencies of the project. To run the project, use `ng serve`.

----------
The developer is using a third-party API called [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) to get all the recipes and ingredients. The project is not yet complete because the developer is thinking if he will subscribe for the additional features that he clearly needs. Or he will stop being lazy and find any free third-party API or any data that he can get online.

Future features:

1. A recipe result for multiple ingredients
2. Limit the result to ingredients added to the list
